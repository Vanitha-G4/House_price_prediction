## Proble statement
  This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various features about houses, such as location, sqft, amenities,   
  etc. The goal of the project is to build a predictive model for estimating house prices based on these features.

## Data set
  * data_set.csv

## Models 
  * Linear Regression
  * Random Forest
  * Decision Tree

## Evaluate the Model
    After training, you can evaluate the model's performance and It calculates evaluation metrics such as:
    * RÂ² Score
    * Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
    * Mean Squared Error (MSE)
